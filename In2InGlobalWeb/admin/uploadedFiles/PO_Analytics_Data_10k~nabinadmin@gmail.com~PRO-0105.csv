  State Prison (MCSP), an adult male prison with custody Level I, III,
  and IV inmates, in the City of Ione, Amador County, California. The
  purpose of the health care facility improvement project at MCSP is to
  remedy deficiencies in the health care components established by the
  California Correctional Health Care Services (CCHCS) program for
  Intermediate institutions. MCSP has deficiencies in primary care,
  specialty care, Administration Segregation Unit (ASU) clinic, health
  care administration, pharmacy, laboratory, and medication
  distribution. Additionally, the Coleman Court found the need for
  treatment and office space improvements to support services to the
  Administrative Segregation Unit Enhanced Outpatient Program (ASU-EOP)
  inmate-patients. The Project includes six sub-projects including the
  construction of new buildings, renovation of existing buildings,
  infrastructure, and ancillary improvements. The following provides the
  conceptual information on the Project:
   
  Sub-Project #1 - Central Health Services Addition and Renovation
   
             
  The existing Central Health Services building will be renovated and
  expanded to provide specialty care and emergency services to the
  entire MCSP inmate-patient population.
   
       
  Sub-Project #2 - Primary Care Clinic Renovations and New Clothing
  Exchange Buildings at Facilities A, B, and C
   
             
  The existing primary care clinics at Facilities A, B, and C will be
  renovated and     expanded into the adjacent clothing
  distribution area to provide primary health care and
           medication
  distribution to the inmate-patient population housed at each of these
      Facilities. The project will additionally construct
  a pre-engineered building at each
            Facility A, B,
  and C for clothing distribution to replace the existing space utilized
  by the
             
  primary care clinic expansion.
   
       
  Sub-Project #3 - New ASU Primary Care and ASU-EOP Mental Health Clinic
 
  
             
  A new single story ASU and ASU-EOP clinic will be constructed between
  housing units 12 and 13 at Facility C to provide a separate primary
  care and mental health EOP clinic for the ASU inmate-patient
  population at MCSP.
   
       
  Sub-Project #4- New Pharmacy and Laboratory Building
   
             
  A new single story Pharmacy and Laboratory Building will be
  constructed central to        
  Facilities A, B, C and the existing Central Health Services building
  to provide
            
  pharmaceutical and laboratory processing services to the entire MCSP
  inmate-patient    population.
   
       
  Sub-Project #5- Health Care Administration Renovation
             
  Health care administration space will be constructed within the
  existing vacant Prison       Industry
  Authority space on Facility A to accommodate staff displaced from
     improvements at the Central Health Services building
  (Sub-project #1).
   
       
  Sub-Project #6- Medication Distribution Room Additions at EOP Housing Units
   
             
  A medication distribution room addition will be constructed adjacent
  housing units A5,    B6, and B7 to provide an efficient and
  safe environment for nursing to administer
             
  medications to the inmate-patient population.",1,Each," $6,95,235.00 ",Lionakis,Architect associations,Professional associations,Work related organizations,Organizations and Clubs,Corrections and Rehabilitation,Unspecified
